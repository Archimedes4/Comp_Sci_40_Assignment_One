Bronze Level -  Basic Understanding:
Completing these questions students will receive a maximum of 60% to demonstrate a basic understanding of the objectives \
1.       If you take out a loan for a fixed amount of time, what should your payments be? The answer is complicated by the fact you are charged interest so you can’t just divide the amount of the loan to be repaid over the amount of time. Fortunately, there is a formula for calculating the payments of a loan.  
![Mortgage Payment Formula](/mortgage-payment-formula.jpg)
 Write a program that accepts p(principle) ,r (interest rate),n( number of payments per year) and outputs the amount to be paid each month. The first two values are positive integers, the third is a value between 0 and 1. Use the JOptionPane boxes for input and output. The first dialogue box should contain a description of the program. Each dialogue box and input box should have appropriate titles, icons, grammar and spelling. Your program should follow the coding standards for comments, identifier names and indentation. Round dollar amounts to 2 decimals. (8 marks)

Silver Level - Good Understanding:\
Completing these questions students will receive a maximum of 80% to demonstrate a good understanding of the objectives. \
2.       Mrs. Latimer is planning for retirement but doesn’t know if she has enough money saved to retire comfortably. The formula to determine the present value of money is ​
![Present Value Formual](/present-value-formula.jpg)
Write a program that accepts FV (future value), i (interest) , and n (years until retirement). FV and n are positive integers, i is a decimal between 0 and 1 and outputs how much money needed to invest to acquire FV by retirement.  Use the JOptionPane boxes for input and output. Each dialogue box and input box should have appropriate titles, icons, grammar and spelling. Your program should follow the coding standards for comments, identifier names and indentation. Round dollar amounts to 2 decimals. (8 marks)

Gold Level - Expert Understand
Completing these question, students will receive a maximum of 100% to demonstrate an excellent understanding of the learning objectives.
To achieve gold level in this assignment, complete the silver level questions BUT allow the user to input the number of compounding period each year. HINT: adjustments in the above formulae apply to interest (i) and n ( number of compounding periods).
